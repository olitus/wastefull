# *waste* full
**Turn landfills into clean energy storage solutions using gravity**

## Background & Description
Landfills are large unused spaces, close to the city, that are filled with waste.
Gravity energy storage needs: lots of space, be close to the city.
We can make andfills into energy banks using system of cranes.


## Process
1. Create dense waste blocks.
2. Pull waste blocks with cranes up and down to store and release gravitational energy.


## Data
1. The total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2018 was **292.4 million short tons**
2. The average landfill size was **600 acres**
3. The U.S. has **3,091 active** landfills and over **10,000 old** municipal landfills, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
4. The average density of MSW is **311.73 kg/m3**


## On each step
### Trash blocks
#### Examples
- [Byfusion](https://www.byfusion.com) is making building blocks from plastic.

#### ToDo
- Maybe there is a way to make trash blocks out of average compressed trash.
- Need more examples here...


### Crane storage
#### Examples
- [Energy Vault](https://energyvault.com) is an example with concrete block
- [Gravitricity](https://gravitricity.com/#about) another example from Scotland

#### Potential
