# *WASTE* FULL
**Turn landfills into clean energy storage using gravity**

## Background & Description
Landfills are large unused spaces, close to the city, that are filled with waste.
Gravity energy storage needs lots of space, some type of heavy blocks, and to be close to the city.
We can make landfills into energy banks using system of cranes.


## Process
1. Create dense waste blocks or trash containers
2. Pull waste blocks with cranes up and down to store and release gravitational energy.


## Data
1. The standard `35 MWh` system is `150 to 160 meters` high with `6,000 to 7,000 bricks` that each weighing `35 metric tons`.[from Energy Vault website](https://energyvault.com/tag/energy-storage-en/)
    - we get `7000 * 35 metric tons / 35 MWh = 7000 metrics tons / MWh`
3. The total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2018 was `292.4 million short tons`
    - `292.4 million short tons ~= 265,000,000 metric tons`
    - we can store tottaly, just from one year waste `265,000,000 metric tons / 7000 metrics tons / MWh ~= 37,860 MWh`
    - we also store all the waste in a usefull manner
    - yes such number are small, but if combined with concrete we can get more weight
5. The average landfill size was `600 acres` [NEED source]
    - that is `600 acres = 2.43 square kilometers`
7. The U.S. has `3,091` active landfills and over `10,000` old municipal landfills [Environmental Protection Agency].
8. The average density of MSW is `311.73 kg/m3`


## On each step
### Trash blocks
#### Examples
- [Byfusion](https://www.byfusion.com) is making building blocks from plastic.

#### ToDo
- Maybe there is a way to make trash blocks out of average compressed trash.
- Need more examples here...


### Crane storage
#### Background
- [Wikipedia on Gravity Batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_battery)

#### Examples
- [Energy Vault](https://energyvault.com) is an example with concrete block
- [Gravitricity](https://gravitricity.com/#about) another example from Scotland
