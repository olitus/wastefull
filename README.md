Turn trash fields into energy storage

Wastefield: large unused spaces, close to the city.
Energy storage needs: lots of space, be close to the city.
We can make wastefileds into batteries via cranes.


## Idea
1. Create dense trash blocks (partially done)
2. Use them with cranes to store and release energy


## Data
1. The total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2018 was **292.4 million short tons**
2. The average landfill size was **600 acres**
3. The U.S. has **3,091 active** landfills and over **10,000 old** municipal landfills, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
4. The average density of MSW is **311.73 kg/m3**
